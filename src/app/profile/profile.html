<h3>Autobiography</h3>

<pre>
  I born Chiang Mai, Thailand, grew up in a supportive but challenging environment that instilled in
  me a deep sense of perseverance and curiosity. From an early age, I demonstrated a strong aptitude
  for problem-solving, often dedicating my time to building complex models. I credit my early
  worldview to the influence of my grandmother's stories, which set the stage for my future
  professional pursuits.
